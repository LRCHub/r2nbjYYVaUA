It's what I'm made of
But I was afraid of
My inner brightness
I could be priceless
Good girls don't speak up
March to the beat of
Somebody else's
Drum and I felt it
Was trying to be somebody
That wasn't me, you know
I had to leave the party
To meet myself and now I know
I got that afterglow
It's like I'm made of gold
Don't need no daylight
Or midnight
'Cause I'm 24 carat gold
I feel so art nouveau
High tea in Tokyo
Don't need no daylight
Or midnight
'Cause I'm 24 carat gold
I got that afterglow
It's like I'm made of gold
Don't need no daylight
Or midnight
'Cause I'm 24 carat gold
I feel so art nouveau
High tea in Tokyo
Don't need no daylight
Or midnight
'Cause I'm 24 carat gold
I'm feeling frosty
Like I'm so costly
Girl in the mirror
I see you clearer
Was trying to be somebody
That wasn't me, you know
I had to leave the party
To meet myself and now I know
I got that afterglow
It's like I'm made of gold
Don't need no daylight
Or midnight
'Cause I'm 24 carat gold
I feel so art nouveau
High tea in Tokyo
Don't need no daylight
Or midnight
'Cause I'm 24 carat gold
Let me show you
I was born to
Lose control
Maybe now
You'll see that
I am made of gold
I got that afterglow
It's like I'm made of gold
Oh
I got that afterglow
It's like I'm made of gold
Don't need no daylight
Or midnight
'Cause I'm 24 carat gold
I feel so art nouveau
High tea in Tokyo
Don't need no daylight
Or midnight
'Cause I'm 24 carat gold
